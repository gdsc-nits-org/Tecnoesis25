## Testing Status

### **Automated Testing**

- [ ] Lighthouse audit (Performance > 90)
- [ ] Bundle size analysis
- [ ] WebPageTest results
- [ ] Chrome DevTools Performance profile

### **Manual Testing**

- [ ] Desktop Chrome (smooth scrolling)
- [ ] Desktop Firefox (compatibility)
- [ ] Desktop Safari (WebGL works)
- [ ] Mobile Chrome (responsive)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS compatibility)
- [ ] Tablet (medium breakpoints)

### **Network Testing**

- [ ] Fast 3G (loads in <3s)
- [ ] Slow 3G (graceful degradation)
- [ ] Offline (service worker if added)

### **Visual Regression**

- [ ] Hero section renders correctly
- [ ] About section layout intact
- [ ] Module cards display properly
- [ ] Team carousel works
- [ ] Footer WebGL renders
- [ ] Loading skeletons appear
